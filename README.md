## 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

### 📝 Project Description

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across different countries. Using Python data analysis tools, it provides visualizations and insights into how the pandemic evolved worldwide, highlighting disparities between nations.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
Import and clean COVID-19 global data from Our World in Data

Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Compare metrics across countries and regions

Visualize trends with interactive charts and maps

Communicate findings through a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook report

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

pandas – data manipulation

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib – basic visualizations

seaborn – statistical visualizations

plotly – interactive visualizations



### 🚀 How to Run the Project

```
### 🔍 Key Insights
Vaccination disparities: Developed nations (~60%+) vs. developing nations (<30%)

Multiple waves of infection in all countries, with Brazil and India showing severe spikes

Death rate variations: 1.1% (US) to 2.8% (Brazil)

Vaccination impact: Noticeable drop in death rates during later waves

Delayed case/vaccination patterns in African countries compared to global trends

### 📊 Sample Visualizations
Interactive choropleth map of global cases

Time series plots of COVID-19 cases and vaccinations

Comparative charts across countries

7-day rolling averages for new cases
